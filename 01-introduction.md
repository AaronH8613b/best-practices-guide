# Security Best Practices Guide

## Introduction 

These are recommended best practices you should start with to begin hardening your project, your coding and devops practices, and to help you begin practicing security as a mindset and habit. Note that this does not replace the need for a professional audit in the future, but does prepare you for it.

The TL;DR is that you should consider:

* Having a private security reporting pipeline with a designated handler and public vulnerability disclosure process
* Following best practices for development, build pipelines, etc.
* Keeping up to date on security practices and vulnerabilities (CVEs, necessary patches, etc)
* Maintaining up-to-date knowledgebases that keep track of security efforts, access privileges, etc.
* Creating processes for handling disclosures and security issues internally
* Keeping milestones in mind for when you need to increase security efforts (e.g. harden further, get an audit, etc)
